📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes Netflix’s subscriber growth and revenue trends (2019–2023) using a combination of quantitative analytics and qualitative sentiment analysis. The objective was to understand the relationship between subscriber fluctuations and revenue performance, while also uncovering customer sentiment drivers impacting churn.

The analysis integrates Python, SAS, Tableau, and Excel, combining statistical modeling with natural language processing (NLP) to deliver business-ready insights and strategic recommendations.

🎯 Business Problem

Netflix experienced periods of subscriber decline despite strong market presence.
This project addresses:

How Netflix’s subscriber base changed over time

Whether subscriber changes directly impact revenue

What customer sentiment reveals about churn drivers

🧠 Key Research Questions

How did Netflix’s subscription base evolve from 2019 to 2023?

What is the correlation between subscribers and revenue?

What customer pain points are driving negative sentiment and cancellations?

📂 Data Sources

Quantitative Data

Quarterly revenue, regional breakdowns, ARPU

Qualitative Data

~300 customer reviews from Consumer Affairs & PissedConsumer

Reviews spanning Q3 2021 – Q2 2022

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Python: Pandas, NumPy, NLTK, Matplotlib (EDA, sentiment analysis, word clouds)

📈 Key Findings

Strong positive correlation (r = 0.9855) between subscriber count and revenue

Significant subscription growth during early 2020 (COVID-19 period)

Noticeable decline in late 2021–early 2022 aligned with negative customer sentiment

Sentiment analysis revealed high dissatisfaction (compound score: -0.995), largely driven by:
